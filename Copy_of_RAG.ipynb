Financial Risk Management\\n  The Company’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk), \\ncommodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, \\nthe Company uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its \\nfinancial performance. \\n i) Market Risk\\n   Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in \\nmarket prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity \\nprice risk and commodity risk.\\n  a) Foreign Currency Risk\\n    Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes \\nin foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are denominated in \\ncurrencies other than Indian Rupee.\\n    The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments at the \\nend of the reporting period.

The Company has a risk \\nmanagement framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs. \\n   The Company’s commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In \\naccordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses over-the-\\ncounter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.\\n iii) Credit Risk\\n   Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing \\nfinancial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises from Company’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables \\nfrom customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. \\nInvestment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits.

Treasury \\npools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the \\nnet surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, \\nreverse repos and similar instruments.

Hedge Accounting\\n  The Company’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other \\nfeedstock, refined products, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Company has adopted a structured \\nrisk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which \\nallows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter \\nswaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\\n  There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a hedge \\nratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the Dollar Offset method and critical \\nterm matching method.\\n The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. \\n - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). \\n - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements. \\n The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\\n Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting\\n A.

Financial Risk Management\\n   The Group’s activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.

Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as \\nequity price risk and commodity risk.\\n   a)  Foreign Currency Risk\\n     Foreign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of \\nchanges in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are \\ndenominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.\\n     The following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments \\nat the end of the reporting period.

The Group \\nhas a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices \\nand freight costs.\\n    The Group’s commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control \\nprocesses. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives \\nand uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and \\nfreight exposure.\\n  iii)  Credit Risk\\n    Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due \\ncausing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group’s activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and \\nreceivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to \\ncustomers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance \\nfunction, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\\n    The Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business \\nactivities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group \\nGuarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group \\nrestricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\\n  iv)  Liquidity Risk\\n    Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains \\nsufficient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local \\nfinancial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure efficient \\nfunding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash \\nflow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\\n    The Group’s liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury \\npools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or \\ninvest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, \\nmoney market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid \\nconcentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\\n(C in crore)\\nParticulars\\nMaturity Profile As at 31st March, 2024 *\\nBelow\\n3 Months\\n3-6  \\nMonths\\n6-12'),\n",

Hedge Accounting\\n   The Group’s business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other \\nfeedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has \\nadopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge \\naccounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded \\nfutures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this \\nobjective. \\n   There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a hedge \\nratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method \\nand Dollar offset method.\\n  The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\\n  - Differences in the timing of the cash flows. \\n  - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves). \\n  - The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements.\\n  The table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\\n  Disclosure of effect of Hedge Accounting:\\n  A.
